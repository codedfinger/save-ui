          Eliminating edible food waste and repurposing inedible waste to
          climate friendly chemicals is at the core of everything we do. We
          believe that reducing food waste at food production, retail, and
          household level can provide numerous benefits for both the planet and
          our communities.

        <p>
          Through our research and consulting facilities, IntelliDigest is
          continuously working on helping governments and the public understand
          the true scale of the food waste issue and the consequences of
          inadequate food waste handling. Advocating for increased awareness
          about measuring food waste inspired our Global Food Loss & Waste
          Tracker system, designed to allow households to monitor their efforts
          and save money through reducing food waste.
